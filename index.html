    <p>
        The comic opens with a city under siege praying to their god for help. Their god Vash appears but is unprepared for the strange magic of The Collector. The Collector destroys the entire city in one move, and captures the now weakened soul of Vash, leaving his body with terrible wounds. Then the body wakes up. It is not Vash, but it has his memories, and it wants Vash back. The Collector seals a fisure in the rock behind her. The-person-who-is-not-Vash-and-not-yet-a-person tries to open the rock with a sword. This is bad for his health as he is also still bleeding out. 
        Okay new plan find an entrance to the cave system. Surely this quest will not become a massive odyssey that collects new friends.
