    <h3>(spoilers for arc 1!)</h3>
    <p>
        The comic opens with a city under siege praying to their god for help. Their god Vash appears but is unprepared for the strange magic of The Collector. The Collector destroys the entire city in one move, and captures the now weakened soul of Vash, leaving his body with terrible wounds. Then the body wakes up. It is not Vash, but it has his memories, and it wants Vash back. The Collector seals a fisure in the rock behind her. The-person-who-is-not-Vash-and-not-yet-a-person tries to open the rock with a sword. This is bad for his health as he is also still bleeding out. 
        Okay new plan find an entrance to the cave system. Surely this quest will not become a massive odyssey that collects new friends.

        <p style="text-align: center;">No amount of spoilers can reduce the reading experience however, the comic doesn't rely on shock to create tension and interest. </p>

    <h4>Kendal</h4>
        <p>I adore Kendal. He is the main character but don't let that fool you into thinking he's boring. When Vash's body wakes up he doesn't imagine himself as a person, merely a body with enough agency to want Vash's soul back. When he is prompted to come up with a name he sees no point. When pressed, he finally choses the name Kendal* which is the name of Vash's sword. He names himself after a weapon! Because he only sees himself as a tool of Vash and not a person!! </p>
        <p>*Kendal, more commonly spelled as Kendall, is a pretty normal name. Unfortunatly, Red has been planning this comic since she was in middle school and didn't know it was a real name. By the time she learned it wasn't simply a fantasy name it was too late and she was attatched. So Kendal he remains.</p>
        <p>Kendal is more than just a sad boy who doesn't think he's a person. He cares extremely deeply about everyone around him. The people he meets often interpret this is naivety, and try to take advantage of him, but his optimism is something he fights for. He may be a week old, but he has the memories of a god, and everything that entails. Kendal choses to see the best in people, and assume good intentions, and that doesn't make him stupid. Indeed, his giving nature and self-sacraficial attitude might cause a lot of problems, but its also how everyone has joined his party. He would have died ten times over without the friends he made from being kind.</p>
    <h4>Alinua</h4>
        <p>Alinua is the first person Kendal meets, even before he has a name. Alinua is a life mage living in exile. Born with the symbol of the Chimeric Plague, she is a ticking time bomb before her magic goes wild and kills the people around her. She lives in fear of losing control, hiding away in a tree, until Vash is destroyed. She tries to heal the-body-that-is-no-longer-Vash, but her magic finally breaks and goes wild. But instead of killing her and everyone around her, she now has a direct connection to the Primordeal Life! Now finally free of the fear that she will kill anyone she meets, she joins Kendal on his journey to save Vash.</p>
        <p>Don't let her healing magic fool you, Alinua is one of the most vicious fighters in town. Vines to ensnare and bludgeon are her go to, but she's never going to pull her punches if you get on her bad side. Watch out for her grand finale, if you manage to knock her unconsious, Primordeal Life will possess her and do far more damage than Alinua ever would independantly. Alinua sees injustice and is mad about it. Where Kendal sees someone in need Alinua sees a threat and is ready to act on it. Speaking of,,,</p>

    <h4>Erin Ruunaser</h4>
        <p>Erin is the next to join the party. He is the Elemental Magus, the only living person who can control all 6* elements. However, he could just as correctly be called the Hubris Wizard. This guy is almost always the most powerful person in the room and he knows it. Born and raised in acedemia, he has connections in high places that deeply want to be on his good side. Self-assured, and usually correct to be, Erin can have a hard time accepting failure. However, he must accept help now that he is possessed by The Void Dragon.</p>
        <p>In his hubris Erin ventured into a deadly eternal storm and found the damaged ancient artifact at it's source. In doing so he become the vessel of the Void Dragon, an ancient primordeal the other six died to capture. Voidy wants out of his prison desperetly, tragically that prison is the entire planet, so our heroes are very motivated to stop him. Erin is now trying to play mind games with the dragon while the dragon does the same, and it's never quite clear who is winning. Erin is cocky and self-conscious, a complete glass cannon, and trying his best.</p>
        <p>*Water, Wind, Stone, Fire, Lightning, and Life</p>

    <h4>Falst</h4>
        <p>If anyone is the lancer of the group it's Falst. Initially he seems to be an enemy creating chimeras to torment a small village, but we soon learn he is being framed! All Falst wanted was to become human (he's a Ferin, a people "cursed" to be monsters), and he was willing to steal magic items from the village and party to do so. In an absolutely heartwrenching scene Kendal wards off attacks while telling Falst that he understands not being human, but being treated like a human when he isn't one sucks! Falst is initially enraged that Kendal has everyone Falst wants and is still unhappy. But then Kendal asks if Falst really wants to be human, or just wants people to be kind and care about him. Oh. Falst has joined the party! Begrudgingly, he totally doesn't like them or anything,,,</p>

    <h4>Dainix</h4>
        <p>Speaking of people Falst totally doesn't like, it's Dainix! Kendal meets Dainix when he is imprisoned for tresspassing in another god's territory as a "weapon of Vash". Prisoners in Zuurith are able to "work off their sentence" by fighting in gladitorial combat. Kendal, wrongfully imprissoned but unable to escape without painting a target on the backs of his friends, is housed with Dainix, the current Champion. Dainix is in trouble because he keeps refusing to kill his opponents, thus undermining the authority of the prison. An amazing fighter, Dainix is soft spoken and emotionally intelligent. When Kendal apologizes for invading his space, Dainix is charmed and saddened by this man who apologizes for being arrested. They commiserate about being able to physically break out of prison, but unable to to do so because of the social and legal powers of Zuurith.</p>
        <p>Dainix has a tragic backstory too. He begins by telling Kendal that he is hunting a monster, and Ravvan (Ignan protective warriors) do. It's called a demon, a being of pure Fire which consumes its own human disguise and decimates cities, and Dainix's people don't have enough information to fight it. Surely this has nothing to do with how Dainix's skin started cracking to reveal licks of flames like molten lava! Surely this is merely his Ignan heritage! (Uh Oh.)</p>

    <h4>Tess Ruunaser</h4>
        <p>Hey what about someone who isn't tragic! Tess is a badass metal caste lighting mage who's main activity before joining the party was <i>punching dragons</i>. She is unaffected when being chased around Zuurith by the city guards and equally unfazed when her brother tells her hes possessed by The Bad Guy Of All Time. She's simply too cool to have a sad backstory, right? Well she certainly thinks so. When she recounts her tale the party is aghast, and she shrugs it off and talks about her adventures. Erin feels <i>immensly guilty</i> for the conditions of her early life, and she tells him to stop acting like everything is always on his shoulders alone, he was a kid for goodness sake. Tess is great.</p>
